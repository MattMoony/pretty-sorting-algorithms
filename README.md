Visualizing Sorting Algorithms
------------------------------

A try to make the work of sorting algorithms visible.<br />
Although the speed may not always be a 100% accurate, 
I hope that the project itself is still quite enjoyable.

New sorting algorithms can easily be added.
The sorting algorithm's function needs to be "async" (as
otherwise, the current sleep function could not be called),
furthermore, the function gets one argument: display.
Its value will be a function that takes an array as an argument
and displays it visually in an HTML5 canvas. Also, the function
can/should keep track of its comparisons and movements, and 
can/should call the function "refresh" with said variable's values
ever so often.
